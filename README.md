# Employee Data Management System

## The Employee Data Management System is a Python-based application designed to manage employee data for a company or organization efficiently. 

## The system allows users to perform essential operations like:
### 1- Adding a new employee.
### 2- Viewing all employees.
### 3- Updating an employee's details.
### 4- Deleting an employee.
### 5- Searching for an employee by their unique ID.
### 6- Saving and retrieving employee data using a CSV file.

## The Key Features of the System:
### Add Employee:
  Enter employee details like ID, Name, Position, Salary, and Email.
  Save the details to a CSV file for persistent storage.
### Update Employee:
  Modify existing employee details.
  Ensure only the required fields are updated without affecting others.
### Delete Employee:
  Remove an employee's data using their unique ID.
  Automatically update the CSV file after deletion.
### Search Employee:
  Retrieve details of a specific employee using their ID.
### List All Employees:
  Display all employees' details in a clear format.
### File Handling:
  Store employee data in a CSV file for long-term access.
  Load data from the file when the program starts.

## How It Works:
### Start the Program:
  The user is presented with a menu of actions (add, update, delete, search, list, exit).
### Perform an Action:
  Depending on the selected option, the program performs the corresponding task (e.g., adding or updating an employee).
### Save Data:
  Changes are saved to a CSV file, ensuring the data is persistent even after the program is closed.
### Retrieve Data:
  Employee details are loaded from the CSV file each time the program starts.
